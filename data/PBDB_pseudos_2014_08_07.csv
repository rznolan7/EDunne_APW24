The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying “upper siltstone” member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones. The conglomerates are poorly sorted, range in color from brown to yellow and are dominated by intraformational carbonate clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Clasts of permineralized wood and rarer presumed charcoal are commonly found in association with vertebrate remains. Diagenetic gypsum and calcite spar is common.

However, several workers noticed the similarity of Kota fishes with the European Toarcian fishes (Schaeffer and Patterson 1984). Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying “upper siltstone” member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones. The conglomerates are poorly sorted, range in color from brown to yellow and are dominated by intraformational carbonate clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Clasts of permineralized wood and rarer presumed charcoal are commonly found in association with vertebrate remains. Diagenetic gypsum and calcite spar is common.

The bonebed is most likely older than Jurassic, however, because it is located considerably below Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) basalts in local section. The Portuguese CAMP basalts have been radioisotopically dated at 198.1 Ma, which would place the basalts in the earliest Jurassic (Sinemurian). However, these dates need to be corrected for decay constant bias and are likely to be a few million years older. In any event, the Portuguese basalts are likely somewhat younger than many other radioisotopically dated CAMP sections in North America and North Africa. A more precise Triassic age determination of the bonebed is not currently possible, because the stratigraphy and geochronology of the Gres de Silves Formation have only been studied in cursory detail. Our research group is currently revising the geology of the formation, and we recently tentatively proposed, based on vertebrate biostratigraphy, that at least part of the ‘AB2’ unit (i.e., that containing the Penina Bonebed) is likely to be late Carnian–Norian in age"" (Brusatte et al. 2014)","""The fossil-bearing bed is a 40 cm thick layer of fine sandstone with a high clay content, that crops out over a length of just 10 m...The layer contains several large bone fragments whose white-bluish colour is conspicuous in the light-red sandstone matrix...The fossiliferous layers at both localities consist of lenses of sandstone within an approximately 200 m thick sequence of red mudstones, the thickest member of the Grès de Silves Formation.""

The palaeoenvironment can be reconstructed as a broad coastal plain with several streams flowing into the sea, and sediment from the nearby, raised hinterland accumulated in fans on the shore (Palain 1976). Schröter (1981) interpreted the mudstones as deltaic sediments with the lenses of sandstone being fluviatile deposits, e.g., from anastomosing deltaic streams. Alternatively, he pointed out that the mudstones might represent tidal sediments, and the lenses of sandstones could be the fillings of estuarine channels. However, Schröter (1981) did not observe tidal sedimentary structures, such as herringbone cross-stratification or flaser bedding, which detracts from the second interpretation.""

The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary.
